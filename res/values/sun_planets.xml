	        The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is almost 
	        perfectly spherical and consists of hot plasma interwoven with magnetic fields. 
	        Chemically, about three quarters of the Sun\'s mass consists of hydrogen, while 
	        the rest is mostly helium. 
	        The Sun formed about 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a 
	        region within a large molecular cloud. Most of the matter gathered in the center, 
	        while the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that would become the Solar System. 
	        The Sun is classified as a G-type main-sequence star (G2V) based on spectral class and it is 
	        informally designated as a yellow dwarf because its visible radiation is most intense 
	        in the yellow-green portion of the spectrum, and although it is actually white in color, 
	        from the surface of the Earth it may appear yellow because of atmospheric scattering of 
	        blue light. Once regarded by astronomers as a small and relatively insignificant star, 
	        the Sun is now thought to be brighter than about 85% of the stars in the Milky Way galaxy, 
	        most of which are red dwarfs.

			Earth (or the Earth) is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and
			fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is also
			the largest of the Solar System\'s four terrestrial planets. It is
			sometimes referred to as the world, the Blue Planet, or by its Latin
			name, Terra.
			Earth formed approximately 4.54 billion years ago by accretion from the
			solar nebula, and life appeared on its surface within one billion
			years. The planet is home to millions of species, including humans.
			Earth\'s biosphere has significantly altered the atmosphere and other
			abiotic conditions on the planet, enabling the proliferation of
			aerobic organisms as well as the formation of the ozone layer which,
			together with Earth\'s magnetic field, blocks harmful solar radiation,
			permitting life on land. The physical properties of the Earth, as
			well as its geological history and orbit, have allowed life to
			persist during this period. The planet is expected to continue
			supporting life for another 500 million to 2.3 billion years.

		    The Moon is the only natural satellite of the Earth and the fifth largest moon in 
		    the Solar System. It is the largest natural satellite of a planet in the Solar System 
		    relative to the size of its primary (i.e. Earth).
            The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth, always showing the same face with its 
            near side marked by dark volcanic maria that fill between the bright ancient crustal 
            highlands and the prominent impact craters. It is the brightest object in the sky after 
            the Sun, although its surface is actually very dark, with a reflectance similar to that 
            of coal. Its prominence in the sky and its regular cycle of phases have, since ancient 
            times, made the Moon an important cultural influence on language, calendars, art and 
            mythology. The Moon\'s gravitational influence produces the ocean tides and the minute 
            lengthening of the day. The Moon\'s current orbital distance, about thirty times the 
            diameter of the Earth, causes it to appear almost the same size in the sky as the Sun, 
            allowing it to cover the Sun nearly precisely in total solar eclipses. This matching of 
            apparent visual size is a coincidence. The Moon is thought to have formed nearly 4.5 billion 
            years ago, not long after the Earth. Although there have been several hypotheses for its 
            origin in the past, the current most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed 
            from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body.
		</item>
		<item>Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it every 224.7
			Earth days. The planet is named after Venus, the Roman goddess of
			love and beauty. After the Moon, it is the brightest natural object
			in the night sky, reaching an apparent magnitude of −4.6, bright
			enough to cast shadows. Because Venus is an inferior planet from
			Earth, it never appears to venture far from the Sun: its elongation
			reaches a maximum of 47.8°. Venus reaches its maximum brightness
			shortly before sunrise or shortly after sunset, for which reason it
			has been known as the Morning Star or Evening Star.
			Venus is classified as a terrestrial planet and it is sometimes called
			Earth\'s "sister planet" due to the similar size, gravity, and bulk
			composition. Venus is covered with an opaque layer of highly
			reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being
			seen from space in visible light. Venus has the densest atmosphere of
			all the terrestrial planets in the Solar System, consisting mostly of
			carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure at the planet\'s surface is
			92 times that of the Earth. Venus has no carbon cycle to lock carbon
			back into rocks and surface features, nor does it seem to have any
			organic life to absorb it in biomass. Venus is believed to have
			previously possessed oceans, but these evaporated as the temperature
			rose due to the runaway greenhouse effect. The water has most likely
			dissociated, and, because of the lack of a planetary magnetic field,
			the hydrogen has been swept into interplanetary space by the solar
			wind. Venus\'s surface is a dry desertscape with many slab-like rocks,
			periodically refreshed by volcanism.
		</item>
		<item>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun in the Solar System.
			Named after the Roman god of war, Mars, it is often described as the
			"Red Planet" as the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a
			reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin
			atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact
			craters of the Moon and the volcanoes, valleys, deserts, and polar
			ice caps of Earth. The rotational period and seasonal cycles of Mars
			are likewise similar to those of Earth, as is the tilt that produces
			the seasons. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the highest known
			mountain within the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, the
			largest canyon. The smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere
			covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature. </item>
		<item>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest planet
			within the Solar System. It is a gas giant with mass one-thousandth
			that of the Sun but is two and a half times the mass of all the other
			planets in our Solar System combined. Jupiter is classified as a gas
			giant along with Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Together, these four
			planets are sometimes referred to as the Jovian or outer planets.
			The planet was known by astronomers of ancient times and was associated
			with the mythology and religious beliefs of many cultures. The Romans
			named the planet after the Roman god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth,
			Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of −2.94, making it on
			average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon
			and Venus. (Mars can briefly match Jupiter\'s brightness at certain
			points in its orbit.)

		    Pluto, formally designated 134340 Pluto, is a large trans-Neptunian object in the Kuiper belt. 
		    It is the second-most-massive dwarf planet known in the Solar System (after Eris) and the 
		    tenth-most-massive body observed directly orbiting the Sun. Like other Kuiper belt objects, 
		    Pluto is composed primarily of rock and ice and is relatively small, approximately one-sixth 
		    the mass of the Earth\'s Moon and one-third its volume. It has an eccentric and highly inclined 
		    orbit that takes it from 30 to 49 AU (4.4–7.4 billion km) from the Sun. This causes Pluto 
		    to periodically come closer to the Sun than Neptune. Discovered in 1930, Pluto was originally 
		    classified as the ninth planet from the Sun. However, its status as a major planet fell 
		    into question following further study of it and the outer Solar System over the ensuing 
		    75 years. Starting in 1977 with discovery of minor planet 2060 Chiron, numerous icy objects 
		    similar to Pluto with eccentric orbits were found. The most notable of these was the 
		    scattered disc object Eris—discovered in 2005, which is 27% more massive than Pluto.
		    The understanding that Pluto is only one of several large icy bodies in the outer Solar 
		    System prompted the International Astronomical Union (IAU) to formally define what it 
		    means to be a "planet" in 2006. This definition excluded Pluto and reclassified it as 
		    a member of the new "dwarf planet" category (and specifically as a plutoid). A number 
		    of scientists hold that Pluto should have remained classified as a planet, and that 
		    other dwarf planets should be added to the roster of planets along with Pluto.

		<item>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest
			planet in the Solar System, after Jupiter. Named after the Roman god
			Saturn, its astronomical symbol (♄) represents the god\'s sickle.
			Saturn is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of
			Earth. While only 1/8 the average density of Earth, with its larger
			volume Saturn is just over 95 times more massive than Earth.
			Saturn\'s interior is probably composed of a core of iron, nickel and rock
			(silicon and oxygen compounds), surrounded by a deep layer of
			metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and
			liquid helium and an outer gaseous layer. Electrical current within
			the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn\'s
			planetary magnetic field, which is slightly weaker than Earth\'s and
			around one-twentieth the strength of Jupiter\'s. The outer atmosphere
			is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived
			features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 km/h.
			Saturn has a ring system that consists of nine continuous main rings
			and three discontinuous arcs, composed mostly of ice particles with a
			smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. Sixty-two known moons orbit
			the planet; fifty-three are officially named. This does not include
			the hundreds of "moonlets" within the rings. Titan, Saturn\'s largest
			and the Solar System\'s second largest moon, is larger than the planet
			Mercury and is the only moon in the Solar System to retain a
			substantial atmosphere.
		</item>
		<item>Mercury is the innermost and smallest planet in the Solar
			System,[a] orbiting the Sun once every 87.969 Earth days. The orbit
			of Mercury has the highest eccentricity of all the Solar System
			planets, and it has the smallest axial tilt. It completes three
			rotations about its axis for every two orbits. The perihelion of
			Mercury\'s orbit precesses around the Sun at an excess of 43
			arcseconds per century, a phenomenon that was explained in the 20th
			century by Albert Einstein\'s General Theory of Relativity. Mercury is
			bright when viewed from Earth, ranging from −2.3 to 5.7 in apparent
			magnitude, but is not easily seen as its greatest angular separation
			from the Sun is only 28.3°. Since Mercury is normally lost in the
			glare of the Sun, unless there is a solar eclipse it can be viewed
			only for short intervals before sunrise when it is near its maximum
			western elongation, or after sunset when near its maximum eastern
			elongation. At relatively high latitudes such as those of many
			European and North American population centres, it is even then near
			the horizon and obscured in a relatively bright twilit sky. However,
			at tropical and subtropical latitudes, Mercury is more easily seen
			because of two effects. (i) the Sun ascends above the horizon more
			steeply at sunrise and descends more steeply at sunset, so the
			twilight period is shorter, and (ii) at the right times of year, the
			Ecliptic intersects the horizon at a very steep angle, meaning that
			Mercury can be relatively high (altitude up to 28°) in a fully dark
			sky. Such conditions can pertain, for instance, after sunset near the
			Spring Equinox, in March/April for the southern USA and in
			September/October for South Africa and Australasia. Conversely,
			pre-sunrise viewing is easiest near the Autumn Equinox.</item>
		<item>Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in the
			Solar System. Named for the Roman god of the sea, it is the
			fourth-largest planet by diameter and the third largest by mass.
			Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth and is slightly more massive
			than its near-twin Uranus, which is 15 times the mass of Earth but
			not as dense. On average, Neptune orbits the Sun at a distance of
			30.1 AU, approximately 30 times the Earth–Sun distance. Its
			astronomical symbol is ♆, a stylized version of the god Neptune\'s
			trident. Neptune is similar in composition to Uranus, and both have
			compositions which differ from those of the larger gas giants,
			Jupiter and Saturn. Neptune\'s atmosphere, while similar to Jupiter\'s
			and Saturn\'s in that it is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium,
			along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, contains a
			higher proportion of "ices" such as water, ammonia and methane.
			Astronomers sometimes categorize Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants"
			in order to emphasize these distinctions. The interior of Neptune,
			like that of Uranus, is primarily composed of ices and rock. Traces
			of methane in the outermost regions in part account for the planet\'s
			blue appearance.</item>
		<item>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the
			third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in
			the Solar System. It is named after the ancient Greek deity of the
			sky Uranus (Ancient Greek: Οὐρανός), the father of Cronus (Saturn)
			and grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter). Though it is visible to the naked
			eye like the five classical planets, it was never recognized as a
			planet by ancient observers because of its dimness and slow orbit.
			Sir William Herschel announced its discovery on March 13, 1781,
			expanding the known boundaries of the Solar System for the first time
			in modern history. Uranus was also the first planet discovered with a
			telescope.
			Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both are of different
			chemical composition than the larger gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn.
			Astronomers sometimes place them in a separate category called "ice
			giants". Uranus\'s atmosphere, while similar to Jupiter and Saturn\'s
			in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, contains more
			"ices" such as water, ammonia and methane, along with traces of
			hydrocarbons. It is the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar
			System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C). It has a
			complex, layered cloud structure, with water thought to make up the
			lowest clouds, and methane thought to make up the uppermost layer of
			clouds. In contrast, the interior of Uranus is mainly composed of
			ices and rock.
